# Surpass Assist: Transforming Road Safety

## Introduction

Surpass Assist is a computer vision-based solution designed to significantly enhance road safety. It uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze road conditions, detect lanes, track vehicles, and gather critical data to ascertain the best and safest opportunities for vehicles to overtake large trucks. The overarching goal is to minimize the occurrence of accidents and alleviate traffic congestion caused by unsafe overtaking maneuvers.

## Features

- **Vehicle and Lane Detection:** Surpass Assist identifies vehicles and lanes on the road accurately, even under varying weather and lighting conditions.
- **Distance Tracking:** The system tracks the distance between vehicles to ensure safe overtaking.
- **Real-Time Data Analysis:** Surpass Assist collects and processes data in real-time for immediate response and decision-making.
- **Safety Alert System:** Alerts are relayed to drivers on when it's safe to overtake the large trucks.
